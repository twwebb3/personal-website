            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Data Science notes section. Here you'll notes on how I approach and think about data science.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="response-modeling">
            <h1>Response Modeling</h1>
            <p>
                Response, or binary classification, modeling is often the solution to picking the lowest hanging fruit
                when solving business problems with machine learning models. The target is a simple binary outcome: did
                an event occur or did it not? This event can be anything from a customer making a purchase to responding
                to a marketing offer. The goal is to predict the probability of the event occuring based on available
                data. The probability score can then be used to improve targeting and optimize resources. Target those
                that are more likely to desire being targeted, and do not bother those that are not.
            </p>

            <section id="response-overall">
                <h2>Overall Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    Here I'll provide a high-level overview of the approach I take when building response models. We'll
                    assume we have the data we need in a SQL table/view or CSV, and it is roughly ready to start
                    building models on.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Convert the target to 1 and 0 values, 1 for the desired outcome.</li>
                        <li>
                            Split the data into train, test, and validation sets. For more detail see <a href="#response-detail-preprocessing">here</a>.

                        <li>Handle missing values: impute or drop them.</li>
                        <li>Convert categorical fields to binary/dummy variables.</li>
                        <li>Scale continuous variables in the training set, and use the same scaling factors on test and validation sets.</li>
